Hi! Iâ€™m Devin, a machine learning researcher affiliated with L1NNA Lab @ Queen's University, Kingston.

Research
======
My research interests lie in consciousness and resource rational analysis. That is, I'm seeking to design models which perform in similar ways to humans when given limited resources. However, my work so far has been focused on solving NLP problems. I proposed a novel way of automating the solution to the software supply-chain attack problem with S-BERT. Currently, I am collaborating on a text-based bias detection study.
