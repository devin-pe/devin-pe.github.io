Hi! Iâ€™m Devin, a Machine Learning student @ University of Amsterdam. I am currently seeking research/internship opportunities. I was previously affiliated with L1NNA Lab @ Queen's University, Kingston.

Research
======
My research interests lie in consciousness and resource rational analysis. That is, I'm trying to design models which perform in similar ways to humans when provided limited resources. I think if these models are conceived in a biologically plausible way they can inform us about human consciousness. So far my work has been focused on solving NLP problems. I proposed a novel way of automating the solution to the software supply-chain attack problem with S-BERT.
